Procedure
---------
 1. Download the CentOS 6 ISO image
    a. Go to http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso and download an ISO from one of the mirror sites.             
    b. Save CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso to your c:\vault\
    
 
 2. Create your CentOS VM (using the VirtualBox software) 
    a. Run "Oracle VM VirtualBox"  [there should be a shortcut on your desktop]
    b. Click on the "New" button
    c. In the "Name and operating system" page, 
       press "Expert Mode"
      
       Name:    CentOS 7
       Type:    Linux
       Version: Red Hat(64-bit)
      
       Memory:  8192 MB      NOTE:  I assume that your box has 16 GB of RAM.  When in doubt, use half
       Hard Disk:  Create a virtual hard disk now
       Press "Create"
   
   c. Create this directory:  C:\tools\virtualBoxVMs\
      
   d. In the "Create Virtual Hard Disk"
      File location:        C:\tools\virtualBoxVMs\centos7.vdi
      File Size:            150 GB     # NOTE:  This is a **CEILING** so go big.  It will not use up all of this space initially
      Hard disk file type:  VDI
      Storage on physical hard disk:  Dynamically Allocated
      Press "Create"
      -- Now, you should see "CentOS 7" VM in the VirtualBox Manager (and it should be powered off)

      
      
 5. Start up your VM and install the operating system
    a. Right-click on "CentOS 7" -> Start -> Normal Start
    b. In the "Select startup disk" page
       1) Press the little button  [that says "Choose a virtual optical drive file..."]
       2) Browse to your c:\vault\CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso
       3) Press Start

     WARNING:  If you see strange errors starting-up your virtual machine
               Then you might need to change your BIOS settings on your Windows computer
               to allow virtualization
                 See this url:  https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/4130
               
               Possible Fixes:
                 A) Change your BIOS so that VT-x is enabled and working
                 B) Change your BIOS so that Trusted Execution is OFF
                 C) Change your BIOS so that Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) is ON and functioning
                 D) Change the number of processors from 1 to 2
                 
                 
  6. Follow the install procedures for your CentOS 7 OS
     a. On the boot loader menu, select "Install Centos 7"
     b. To begin testing the media press OK
        Select "Skip" (by pressing Enter)
     c. In the CentOS Installation Summary screen wait for the OS to load Localization settings
        1) Date & Time, Keyboard & Language Support (FEEL FREE TO CHANGE THESE IF NEEDED)        
     d. Under the Software settings 
        1) Installation Source will auto-load
        2) Select "Software Selection"
            A) You're likely going to want a desktop for this VM so select either "GNOME Desktop" or "KDE Plasma Workspaces"
            B) Check the "Development Tools" under the "Add-Ons for Selected Environment"
            C) Select any additional add-ons you would likely & click "Done" 
     e. Under the System settings
        1) Installation Destination 
           B) You need to verify that you want automatic partitioning by going into that menu & clicking "Done"
        2) KDump 
           A) Disable Kdump by clicking on the KDump option & unchecking the checkbox.
        3) Network & Hostname 
           A) Toggle the On/Off Switch to connect to the ethernet network attached to your host machine. 
           B) Rename your host by changing the value in the "Host name" input : centos7VM
        4) Security Policy
           A) If you need to apply any security policies select them from this list & the appropriate packages will be installed.
        
     f. Select "Begin Installation"

https://serverfault.com/questions/709433/install-a-newer-version-of-git-on-centos-7

If you chose to install "Development-Tools" as described above you'll already have a version of git installed by yum.
https://blacksaildivision.com/git-latest-version-centos
To install without overriding, follow the Git instructions & then lastly create a profile init script that will use the /usr/local prefixed git instead of the yum installed one.

Adding GIT to $PATH
Here is the important part of this tutorial. To force using GIT that was just installed we need to add it to $PATH. It will prevent running git installed with yum.

Create file git.sh in this location:

sudo vi /etc/profile.d/git.sh
and paste there following contents:

pathmunge /usr/local/git/bin

Log out & log back in again and run git --version.
